## Introduction

- I successfully completed Workshop 0 and was inspired to create another animation using similar techniques for the workshop 1. For my next project, I decided to develop an abstract animation, focusing primarily on changing its colors dynamically. I referred to the p5.js tutorial on variables and change (https://p5js.org/tutorials/variables-and-change/) and explored various online resources for creating abstract animations. There were numerous exemplars and projects related to popping colourful animations, many of which were highly engaging and provided valuable inspiration.
- There was an reference on google doodles called https://www.google.com/logos/doodles/2017/fischinger/fischinger17.9.html?hl=en 'Fischinger' when I was in my college days and remembered if I could make a similar version to this but quite different. I was quite obsessed on the shapes, but even more, the colours. They were light colours, and beautiful at the same time, too.

- I began to research from the p5js references and on google and youtube, on how abstract shapes were made, and they weren't what i expected.
